It is basically D&D, but the player characters are set in advance. You don't have to look up stuff in guides, because info about armor class and damage and spells and such, are all on the playing cards. Nobody has to play the role of Dungeon Master, because the encounter/instructions tell you what all the monsters do, who they go after, etc. It is also random each time, because the way you place the board tiles and draw cards, it makes it different. There are a zillion parts/pieces, so I recommend you get a little case with subdividers to hold everything, or else get a bunch of ziplock bags.\",\n",

Received it today and I IMMEDIATLY fell in love with how durable the case looks, and feels on my phone. I was really impressed with how firmly it snapped onto the back of my phone. I was slightly skeptical about that, since the back that comes on the phone seems to be flimsy once removed. The  case stays firmly shut after being flipped open for certain periods of time with ease.  Like the phone, the features it presents when the case is closed on the S View screen are fluid and distinct. It has everything I would need when not looking at the phone with the case open. I would DEF recommend this to anyone with a new note III, or who are considering getting this. I work for a bank and constantly have tons of keys floating around in my purse, I no longer have to worry about any surface of my new Galaxy Note 3 getting scratched just by simply tossing my phone into my purse.

We've owned mats before that were more expensive than these and lasted quite awhile, but were nowhere near as comfortable and well made. I highly recommend giving your mats a good bath before you use them. You're not supposed to use oil based detergents but we'd run out of Dr B's non oil-based castile soap and just used the lavender oil-based one which worked fine, (not surprising since it's such an awesome soap) then set the mats out to dry in the sun. I've come to find that no matter how you wash your mat, this step is very important. The sun further removes the resin that's been applied before shipping. Bottom line? This mat is thicker, longer, more durable, and made with better material than most other mats you'll find for this price. As an added bonus, the designs are really cool and the customer service is prompt and personable. You can't go wrong with one of these beautiful mats.\",\n",

They required me to take a bunch of pictures, make a bunch of phone calls, and email them before they would send a replacement.  All over a $10 product.

This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.<br /><br />Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!<br /><br />2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.<br /><br />3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.<br /><br />Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!\",\n",

It has 'Clear Voice' which is intended to emphasize speech but is helpful only in this function.<br /><br />On the negative side: It DOES work with computers but does NOT have RGB so it's useless for my PC at the moment. I could buy a PC-TV card, but am slightly surprised at this omission.  Also, compared to my Toshiba, it does not do well with 2nd rate signals.  Unless you have HDMI, you'll have an acceptable picture but nothing approaching 'hi def'.  I have it on a simple video/audio RCA connection and its picture is fine, but far from stellar...The major shortcoming on the set, and virtually all sets short of the premium large ones is sound.  A wafer thin plastic cabinet does not provide a means of resonance nor of having proper speakers. As a 2nd set for a room, it's OK; for a primary use set, you should add supplemental speakers, etc.<br /><br />The key thing to remember is no RGB computer hookup.

The wig comes in a solid, hard box with netting; great for re-storage. It's thick enough and definitely does not have bald spots. The top curls are well secured with some kind of bobby pins. The side curls held up very well after two months of handling (taking it out, putting on, repackaging). It has elastic straps inside for size adjustment.<br /><br />Things of Note: I tried it first with just my hair pinned up. It was a little loose and the next strap adjustment notch was too tight on me. Next I tried it with a cheap wig cap which really made the wig slide around. The cap got a run after the first usage and got tossed anyway. What I found worked great for me was a pair of control top panty hose with the legs cut off and tied to make a wig cap. The ribbing texture on the hose gave the wig something to grip to and it stayed on securely and comfortably, even through some light activity (tilting head back and a slight skirmish with other characters onstage). Recommend also using a few bobby pins for extra security. The last thing any actress wants is to lose her hair onstage.<br />The bangs are a little long and do have a tendency to get in one's eyes. The plus side is they are very thick and don't look cheap. I suppose you could trim them, however I couldn't bear to cut such a beautiful wig.\",\n",

Machining was a little crude but this is expected from Chinese made products. A hole in the threaded nut for the bipod adapter was drilled a bit off center though. This was a quick fix on the drill press. The adapter fit the Ruger well and looks good. It has a black painted finish. The friction leg nuts and release buttons are nicely finished. Good enough for a .22 or a bolt action .223. The bipod is bulky when folded up and is a bit obtrusive. I would not put it on an assault rifle as it would snag on things when on the move.

I cannot over state this.  Samsung LED TV\\'s are simply gorgeous, and this \"lower-end\" model is no different.  It\\'s much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55\" Samsung LED TV.  Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark.

In my opinion (and more importantly the wife\\'s!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV.  And I\\'m sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better).  My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume.  What do I mean?  To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD!

       " ('I rather liked this weird, shocking and less than half-serious 1972 crime film, even if it is not exactly a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.    Irish mob bosses from Chicago have a problem - one of their business partners, known as Mary Ann (Gene Hackman) owes them money - in fact A LOT of money - and not only he obstinately refuses to pay, but treats most unkindly all those who are send to collect. Mary Ann lives on a farm near Kansas City and officially makes his money in cattle slaughtering and meat packaging, but in fact he is a dangeorus and vicious crime lord, ruling his rural neighborhood almost as a feodal duke.    Having received loud and clear (by mail) Mary Ann\\'s latest unequivocal (and, in a way, very tasty) refusal to pay, Chicago mob bosses decide to send in another crew of debt collectors - this time more numerous and especially headed by a particularly vicious enforcer, Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin). Other than 50.000 dollars fee Devlin is also incited to take this offer by the oportunity of revenge - indeed, between him and Mary Ann there is considerable beef (sorry, I couldn\\'t resist)... And then the film really begins.    This film mixes elements of:    - gangster movie, as there is lots of gangsters    - film noir, as there is a femme not only fatale but \"tres fatale\"    - western, as there are gunfights and chases in a very rural environment, and also lots of chattel (both four and two legged), shotguns and hats,    - parody, as the two bad guys, both muy macho, are called Mary Ann and Weenie...)))    - soft porn, as for most of the film young Sissy Spacek, for whom it was the first role ever, (and who is cute like a button and absolutely delicious as a damsel in distress) runs completely naked, full frontal included... We also learn a lot about intimate life of little orphan girls who never saw a man...    - promotion of vegetarianism becasue CLASSIFIED TO AVOID SPOILERS - but believe me, you will probably not want a steak or a sausage for some time after watching \"Prime Cut\"    - child movie (SPOILER WARNING HERE), as at one moment murderous gangsters with machine guns will mount on the white horse (OK, in fact get in a black car - but metaphorically speaking it is true) to save a virgin princess kept in a tower and later a lot of poor orphans from a bad, bad, bad lady...    As we can see, the coctail is indeed exotic and sometimes surrealistic - in fact it reminds me a little bit of Quentin Tarantino scenarios...    This film contains some deliberately very shocking scenes, including a slave auction - it certainly made a splash in 1972 - all rhytmed by a very good musical score by Lalo Shiffrin. Action scenes however aged a lot and are rather boring and the great finale showdown is very, very disappointing. Dialogs are a mixture of good one liners and smart come backs, but also sadly some banalities. Finally, actions of the bad guys finally don\\'t make much sense and for that reason the frontal shock between Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman doesn\\'t deliver as much as it could be expected.    But still it is an interesting film, with two excellent actors, a cute (and naked) damsel in distress, some shocking moments, some good dialogs, a femme (tres) fatale and, let\\'s say it again, a lot of beef... ENJOY!',\n",

It is very well written, and covers the whole breadth of her amazing life.  It is very fair: it doesn't whitewash Day's crankiness or stubbornness or (to an outsider) her willful adherence to a Church that bears no relationship to anything Jesus would have had any part of, on any reasonable reckoning. The community of spirits and the communion of souls are more present in the Catholic Worker's activities in the soup kitchens than in all the popery and bishoprics.  Still, if it was good enough for St. Francis, then it seems to have been good enough for Dorothy Day.  Whether it is worthy of them is a deeper question.<br /><br />Whole sections of the book resonate with the dire situation of the American poor today in the New Depression; and also remind us of the vast political struggle that went on then to wrestle even some kind of mercy from the capitalist machine.  It reminds us of how much people suffered to bring about the basic safety net that ideologues are working day and night to dismantle in favour of the mercilessness of the harsh Gods of the Blessed Free Market.  And how much of that suffering is now, and will likely have to be suffered all over again.<br /><br />The book also reminds us of the stultifying world in which Day operated, and the dreariness of much of it: the drab buildings, the endless dishwashing and sweeping, the narrow mindedness.  It also reminds us of how early Day and her colleagues were in so many protests: anti-nuclearism, race and Vietnam being only a few of them.  It would be a good book to give to contemporary activitists:  perhaps the strongest message in the book is the need for order and discipline throughout both the dreariness and the wildness; and the essential role of daily prayer (of whatever kind) to keep one going in the midst of the burdens of chaos and failure on many levels.\",\n",

       " (\"*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />'Bellissima' begins with a radio presentation of Donizetti's opera L'elisir d'amore (The Elixir of Love). In it, a poor peasant, Nemorino, falls in love with Adina, a beautiful landowner. He relies on a charlatan's magic potion that he believes will help him to gain Adina's love. We're suddenly interrupted by an announcement of a casting competition for (real-life) director Alessandro Blasetti, who is searching for a child, age 6 to 8, to star in his latest film. 'Bellissima' is heralded director Luchino Visconti's third film and he wastes no time in introducing us to the crazy world of the Italian film industry, where a large gaggle of star struck stage mothers accompanied by their little tots are attempting to get their 'big break' in the movie business.<br /><br />Perhaps the most determined of all the mothers is our protagonist, Maddalena Cecconi, played by subsequent Oscar winner, the superb Anna Magnani. She lives in a working-class tenement with her equally 'passionate' husband, Spartaco, who both appear to be good parents to little Maria, the unprecocious child who Maddalena is convinced is the next 'Shirley Temple'. Like Nemorino in Donizetti's opera, Maddalena needs a magic potion to escape the drab existence which she perceives is her life--and that magic potion is the film contract which will enable her to live vicariously through her daughter's success. If Spartaco tries to convince his obsessed wife that motion pictures are just a 'fantasy', Maddalena will have none of it--every week there's another Hollywood picture projected on the big screen in the building's courtyard and Maddalena is enraptured whenever a big actor like Montgomery Clift makes his captivating appearance.<br /><br />Back to the initial auditions: Maddalena finally finds little Maria with her soiled dress by a pool--the rest of the stage mothers have already been let in to the studio and a seeminglykind director's assistant, Alberto Annovazzi, manages to get Maddalena and Maria inside the doors, despite the late hour.<br /><br />We break into Act II when Maria is chosen for a call back audition. Visconti doesn't only affectionately ridicule the naïve Maddalena but Italian society in general, obsessed with their own self-interest. It begins with an older washed-up actress who shows up at Maddalena's door insisting that she has the ability to polish the little one's act and ensure she wins the film competition. Later Spartaco kicks the woman out of the house, but up until that point, Maddalena doesn't question her credentials, only hoping that the woman's instruction will give her little one, an edge.<br /><br />Due to her naivety about the film business, Maddalena is often gullible with those she interacts with; but she's also stubborn and aggressive. The obsessed mother butts heads with a photographer referred to her by Annovazzi and a dress maker, who hilariously doesn't buy into taking injections for preventative health (Maddalena works a nurse and gives injections to diabetics). More funny stuff: a hairdresser allows his young son to cut Maria's pigtails and Maddalena expects instant results during initial ballet lessons (dig the crazy ballet director's absurd dance across the studio floor!). There's also a great scene where Maddalena accuses Spartaco of beating her--the gossipy neighbors get in on the act, and take Maddalena's side (in contrast to their constant criticism of her).<br /><br />Visconti throws in a nice twist when Annovazzi hits Maddalena up for the 50,000 lire which was going to be used for the purchase of a new house. Annovazzi tells Maddalena he'll use the money to make the necessary connections to ensure Maria gets the screen test. The twist is that Maddalena doesn't seem to mind that he used most of the money to buy a scooter for himself. And when Annovazzi tries to seduce Maddalena during a visit at her mother-in-law's, Maddalena alsoisn't perturbed at all--she dismisses it as men's 'typical behavior'.<br /><br />Before the classic denouement, Maddelena meets a woman who she recognizes as a former actress in a couple of director Blasetti's movies. She warns Maddelina that the move business isn't what it's cracked up to be. After acting in two films, she didn't get anywhere, so she took the more mundane job as a film editor. Still, Maddalena is undeterred and believes there's still a chance Maria might be selected. So she finagles her way up the projection room and watches the rushes. To her chagrin, Maria breaks out crying during her screen test. Blasseti's colleagues (including Annovazzi) find this uproarious and burst out laughing. Maddalena confronts the director and chastises him and his colleagues for their bad behavior. Blasseti basically agrees with Maddalena and fires Annovazzi on the spot. But that's not enough to assuage Maddalena's hurt feelings and she storms off.<br /><br />At this point, Maddalena's world is shattered. Sitting on park bench, she clutches Maria and cries out, 'Help'. Back at the studio, Blasseti watches the rushes again and improbably sees a different Maria. Before you know it, the studio executives are offering Maddalena and Spartico a contract for Maria to star in their next picture. But Maddalena, no longer living in the world of illusion, does the 'right thing' and tells the executives that the film business is not for her daughter or for the rest of the family.<br /><br />Most of 'Bellissima' I would describe as comic but there are moments (particularly the ending) which are more touching and poignant. On occasion, the constant bickering between some of the characters, goes on a little too long but for the most part, Visconti's narrative displays brilliant insights into the unfortunate human phenomena known as selfishness. The many layered, brilliant performance of Anna Magnani and the supporting players is the type of acting you rarely see anymore. This is afilm that I highly recommend for those who enjoy watching classic cinema.\",\n",

       " ('Initially we bought the 19\" Conoco [[ASIN:B00768SS8K CONOCO Piano Lamp Portable 19\" LED Piano Lamp, Black w/Brass Accent]].  That lamp, because of its design, (and the design of our Yamaha C3 music bench) would not illuminate the entire sheet of music from top to bottom unless the shade was adjusted (rotated) out...and then the LEDs shined directly into our eyes.  Instead of simply returning the lamp, we called Conoco customer service and found out what a great company this is.  After explaining the issue to the tech, he immediately suggested two other solutions for us: a 14\" lamp with a gooseneck arm between the lamp and clamp, and this 22\" lamp, where the radius of the attachment arms is about twice that of the 19\" lamp.  We chose this one and can only say \"wow!\"<br /><br />Not only is the lamp more suitable because of the attachment arm radius, it also has a height adjustment which we\\'ve set to accommodate some of the larger page-size, antique sheet music pieces we use.  The light quality and quantity is superb and because of the design of this model, it also illuminates the keyboard, without any light overflow into our eyes.  We absolutely, without reservation, recommend this lamp!<br /><br />One final word about Conoco: not only was the customer service tech helpful in understanding and suggesting solutions to our issue with the first lamp, he went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied.  After making the decision to try this lamp, the first question he asked was \"how can WE do this?\" I suggested going back through Amazon.  His comment was that if we needed any additional help, to just call him.  Overall, a very satisfying customer experience.<br /><br />***Update 12/2013***<br />We just bought a second one of these for our son\\'s family.  Each time they visit, they admire this lamp, so we bought one for them as a gift.  We still love it and use it every day.',\n",

This book is written in diary format, which for one I love. It made it so easy to read and to absorb. I feel absorbance is the purpose. When we absorb things we become forced to think about them. Thought is a power motivator in life. People in this world are no longer free thinkers. We watch exactly what is put in front of us, and we accept it as gospel.<br /><br />When you read this book you know acceptance is not option. Xiao's has obviously taken much time and put much thought into this book. We as people have to learn to upgrade our thought process. I for one am an academic. I can test with the best and score high. I have excellent memorization skills. But it goes no further than that. Yes I am memorizing but I have never learned to absorb it. I am 37 years old. And it's truly sad. When it comes to my life I am testing at a D level at best.<br /><br />If we continue on this path of learning and not absorbing we are a doomed species. I think this book it gets to the heart of it all. So our youth can grow, learn and absorb. It has always been about how much you can learn and how fast. It needs to be about what you learn and what you can absorb, and use to help humanity. I believe that this book is trying to help us a people open our minds wider so we can absorb more. It's definitely a book that will leave you with a lot to think about in the end.\",\n",

Whether you\\'re experienced or are new to gluten-free cooking, this book would be among my top 3 choices - not only for the recipes ( you can check out the ones I tested and the results below) but some unique special features. There are instructions on how to prepare several special flour mixes.. There is also comprehensive information about many  other aspects of gluten-free living. This is an impressive resource.    A major asset of this book are the instructions for creating  3 special baking flour blends, each with special advantages. There is the Basic Gluten-Free All-Purpose Homemade Flour Blend. Then there is  a High- Protein and Fiber All Purpose flour blend as well as another option-  a High-Protein, Low -Glycemic Flour blend.     These special mixes do NOT appear on any store shelves and are only in this book.    Listed below are the results of a round of testing recipes and the results.  Below that is a section on the special features of this book. The author is an active member of the advisory board of the Celiac Disease Program at Children\\'s National Medical Center as well as the executive editor of Delight Gluten-Free magazine.    I do think it is important to note that if you are following a low-calorie or low-fat diet, you will need to keep a CLOSE eye on the calorie and fat counts per serving. Many are high. Even so, I found that by making a few simple substitutions . I could  lower calories and fat to acceptable levels. However, the recipes I tested for this review have NOT been altered or tweaked from the original instructions.     Also, there are a fair number of recipes here that are reasonably low in calories. These include: Veggie Pizza, Crab and Oyster Mushroom Bisque, Gazpacho salad, Spiced Kale Chips, Stuffed Mushrooms (Lemon, Ricotta and Kale filling)    On to the recipes:    Here\\'s what we made on Day 1: We started with Herbed Hummus, anice mixture of garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, parsley, chives, and garlic. It was incredible, eaten on its own or served with gluten-free crackers. This is a recipe which is easily tweaked a bit so if you hate cilantro, as some do, add a bit more parsley or adjust to taste. We followed the recipe just as written. We devoured it within an hour.     Next on the agenda? Another appetizer, Baked Potato Chips with Parsley, Garlic and Sea Salt. This is an easy snack recipe to prepare and clean-up is minimal, especially if you have parchment paper on hand to line the baking sheets (as recommended by the author) These chips could also be a side dish with dinner. They had a nice depth of flavors, and the simple additions of garlic and parsley were just the right touches. You can modify this one easily to accommodate your favorite spices.     Moving on to dinner: we made Green Beans with Tomatoes, Garlic, and Onions. We had fresh green beans and tomatoes waiting to be used. It took less than 15 minutes to pull this one together (not counting time to remove the ends from the fresh green beans) . Fresh green beans, onions, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes. Delish!    Then came Pan- Seared Chicken Cutlets with Mushroom Gravy. Took minutes to make and the gravy turned simple  chicken cutlets into a gourmet dish.    We wanted a simple dessert for the meal\\'s finish so we went with the Flan de Coco, easily made with staple ingredients found in our refrigerator and pantry. Very satisfying.     We didn\\'t have time to cook many breads except for quick breads. The Peach Yogurt Quick Bread was a smash hit - as were the Oatmeal Pancakes and the Buttermilk Cheddar Breakfast Biscuits. I\\'m particularly interested in seeing how the sandwich bread turns out and will update this review then. To be honest, by the time we got to breads  I was feeling too tired to tackle more.    Special features of this cookbook: In addition to the standardinfo about foods which contain gluten, there is an extensive list of gluten-free ingredients, safe food additives, unsafe foods,etc. The info on Food Labeling Laws in the United States was helpful for me as well as special tips on \"Navigating the Grocery Store for Home Cooking\" .',\n",

       " (\"Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I'm older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.<br /><br />I don't have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUK Edge Shave Gel, Extra Protection, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] and my [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]], some days [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]] takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]], maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It's just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I've used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn't particularly strong and doesn't linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with [[ASIN:B00A0J09GG Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, 3.3 Ounce]]and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I'm going to be out in the sun or on days when I don't shave (which are usually the same day).<br /><br />I really like this Dove post shave product. There's a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.\",\n",

       " ('This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you\\'ll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.<br /><br />Villisca was a Thornton Wilder \"Our Town\" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town\\'s railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores\\' doorstep one dark night.<br /><br />It\\'s strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film\\'s commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town\\'s larger life.<br /><br />A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990\\'s and early 2000\\'s. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.<br /><br />The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town\\'s primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We\\'ve been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It\\'s also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.<br /><br />These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. \"Villisca\" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.<br /><br />There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.',\n",

We replaced our original $200 Summer color video monitor with the Infant Optics monitor, after briefly trying out the $150 Motorola monitor, and there are several key improvements we noticed over the others we've tried:<br />1. The image clarity is excellent using the standard lens, in both day and night mode.<br />2. The sound quality when talking to your child is impressive - it sounds very realistic, even when singing lullabies to our toddler!<br />3. The screen is large, and the interface is easy to use.  I enjoy the kick-stand as well.<br />4. The temperature monitor is very helpful to have, and seems accurate.<br /><br />My only bones to pick with the product are:<br />1.  If you lay the monitor down without the kickstand, the sound is reduced because the speaker is covered.<br />2.  I wish that Infant Optics also manufactured a silicon case for the monitor - I firmly believe in having a case for all my electronic devices, no matter how well made.<br /><br />I love this product, and recommend it to anyone looking for a great baby monitor with 2-way voice, day/night picture mode, a thermometer, and a great lens.

       " (\"We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it. Kids today seem only interested in themselves and what's going on in the present, never caring what happened before they were born. The saddest part of this is the fact that in being this way they never expose themselves to some of the greatest things in the world, everything from classic novels to pieces of art that have survived centuries. With any luck a few of them will watch THE MONUMENTS MEN and consider doing so.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as Frank Stokes, a military officer in World War II who presents a case to President Roosevelt about the famous works found in museums in Europe. In this presentation he shows Roosevelt famous pieces of art that have gone missing, supposedly taken by Hitler to be put on display when he wins the war in a specially built structure. That is if he doesn't damage them first or if the allies don't damage them while fighting battles from one town to the next. Stokes request is that a special select group of men work to save these pieces of art before they are all destroyed. Given the go ahead, he assembles his team.<br /><br />The team is small. There aren't that many people qualified or willing to be a part. Each has their own role to play in helping with this seemingly impossible task. Included in the group are James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). These are the Monuments men, the elite group that sets out to fulfill the task Stokes has set forth. Granger is sent undercover to find out as much information as he can concerning the whereabouts of artwork stolen in France. The rest are split into teams and sent searching for other various artifacts.<br /><br />Using various methods they accumulate enough knowledge that they discover a patternused in the transport of these works of art. It appears that each location on the map they point out with the clues presented there are underground mines where the art has been stored, at least in part. As the troops move forward, the team accompanies them in an attempt to fulfill their mission. Placing their lives in danger, not all will come home, but each will play his part in this truly historic mission.<br /><br />This gives you the basic idea of what the movie is about. What it doesn't do is show the admiration these men had for not just the task at hand but the items they were sent to save. While some might find a Rembrandt of a museum quality piece of artwork in a foreign church boring, these men look upon each with reverence and respect. The military might see their job as unworthy of their efforts but a twist results in them finding more than they bargained for.<br /><br />Based on the true story of this team the movie offers it all. There is plenty of camaraderie among the team, an affection that develops between them as they move forward. There is the awe that each one inspires with the items they find. There is humor in various moments where things can be light hearted. And there is tragedy as some fall to the enemy.<br /><br />What makes this movie important though is to consider what it was they actually accomplished. To think that some of these pieces might have disappeared (which some actually did) makes their story one of success where few thought it could happen. That they were able to rescue as much as they did is an amazing feat and one that should be lauded. I found it amazing that it took this long for their story to be told.<br /><br />The movie offers not just great entertainment but a piece of history that all should be made aware of. It's a film that young people should see to realize that there was a world out there before they were born and that many things they take for granted could simply have not been there if not for the efforts ofpeople like this. Ipads, Ipods and Facebook are all great things but not near as great as what these people saved. It would be nice to know that at least a few people in the world appreciate the work that they did. Hopefully young people will find enough interest to watch this movie and feel a bit of that.\",\n",

If you want to see what made the American popular song in pre-Elvis days, listen to the score by two of Broadway's best songwriters, Harry Warren, the Italian guy, and Al Dubin, the Jewish guy. Don't miss the bonus short with Harry Warren at the piano playing some of his many hit songs (while a typical 30's group of singers gather round the piano). Do Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell seem  kind of weak in their roles: the audience loved both through the next years.<br />I can't say I remember seeing it when it was made in 1932, although I was around at the time, but I did see it frequently in the third and fourth run movie houses a few years later. It still enlivens me and I think it will many of you. If nothing else, it will be a compendium of later Hollywood cliches (as well, I should think, of Carol Burnett/Harvey Korman, et al. skits, decades later).\",\n",

So far he's used it for soldering jobs, fixing eyeglass hinges and threading needles (yeah, he sews too!).

The ear cushions are supple and comfortable, even for wearing for extended periods. I acknowledge that I\\'m not a hardcore audiophile, but I\\'ve been listening to music since 78-rpm phonograph records were the primary media, so I do have some idea what good audio sounds like. I ran through one of my favorite playlists, and the music sounded as good or better than with any of the headphones that I\\'ve used. Vocals had excellent clarity, and the range of sound was very good with rich trebles and deep, but not overpowering, bass. One feature that I haven\\'t seen on any headphones that I\\'ve used is the bass level control, a rotating dial on the left headphone. To my ears, it had a small but noticeable effect on the bass level, but my preference was to leave it in the default position.<br /><br />Two of the songs that I use to check out headphones and speakers are Annie Lennox\\'s \"Love Song For A Vampire\" (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris\\' \"Wipe Out\" with drummer Ron Wilson\\'s continuous drum riff. Both sounded great with the MX7 headphones. I also played a couple of stereo setup utilities (\"Channel Balance Test\" and \"Stepped Stereo Pan Test\"), and the headphones passed with flying colors.<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I wore them for a hour on two occasions while evaluating them. The adjustable headbands allowed a good fit, and the thick ear cushions were comfortable. Both headbands will extend up to 1½\", and the earcups will rotate about 15 degrees horizontally for the most comfortable fit.<br /><br />The headphone kit includes a 52\" cable with an inline microphone (for using with a smartphone) and 3.5mm plugs. The plug that fits into the headphones has a rotating locking mechanism that ensures that the plug can\\'t work loose, a very helpful feature. The headphones and cable fit nicely ina zippered soft case.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones are premium-quality headphones that combine exceptional audio quality and comfortable design to give a very pleasurable listening experience.',\n",

       " (\"CAT'S REACTION: My cat is extremely finicky.  He has turned his nose up at several toys and gadgets in the past.  He is afraid of the unknown - so much so, that he wouldn't let me even approach him with another grooming tool.  When he hears the velcro, he sits down expecting to be petted.  He is typically afraid of my son but becomes VERY affectionate when my son is using this mitt.  Lots of head butting and licking.  This is pretty universally seen as approval from the cat.  He is welcome to leave any time, but stays for extended period of times when using the love glove.  EASY TO USE:  The use of this mitt is completely natural.  Put it on, and start petting your feline (or canine) friend.  Cleaning fur off of this mitt is very easy. I usually just peel the hair off, although it can be rinsed as well.  QUALITY: I have had this for over two years and it has not fallen apart or become damaged in any way.  CRITICISM:  Some say this doesn't do a good enough job of removing fur, and/or fills up too fast.  Maybe true.  But if it makes my cat happy, I guess that's all I need.  BOTTOM LINE: While your mileage may vary, I am confident this will work for many cat &#34;owners&#34; as it has worked for me.  I recommend you buy it.  In fact, I am buying a second so I can use it on both hands at once.\",\n",

I give kudos to keeping the animation the same as the previous LE and soundtrack score also fits nicely with the series,also you do get a special treat if you saw the first LE series as we see the return and cameos of characters from that series which is appreciated. The voice cast for both the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did a great job though with some of the previous LE characters they will of course sound somewhat different in the dub audio as the original voice actors and actress couldn't or wouldn't come back to dub their character voices though the people picked to dub those characters did a stellar job.<br /><br />So if you already have the first Last Exile series then this is a must have to add on to your anime collection or if you're just looking for a good anime series in general....\",\n",

I generally only use them on my upper arms, because that's where I'm least happy with my skin, although there's no reason you couldn't use this all over.    It has a lovely citrus (lime) scent.  It separates a little when stored but the container does mention that you should mix it up before using.  Shaking will not be effective -- you'll want something stiff like a knife to stir it, because it's pretty thick. Or just take the shortcut I've been using and try to get a little of the oil and a little of the solid part and mix it in your palm.    I can really feel this working.  One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving.  I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt.  So just be careful where/when you apply it.  (It's not bad, but it was somewhat surprising the first time I experienced the sensation, so I thought I would mention it.)    The salt dissolves as you rub this around.  When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower.  And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion.    In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this.  Plus, I love the smell.  I'm torn as to whether to buy a different scent (so I can try them all) or get the same one again, when I run out.\",\n",

       " (\"I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.<br /><br />I have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.<br /><br />If you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)<br /><br />If you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for.\",\n",

The remake of \"The Haunting\", for example, managed to be too literal and show too much which undermined its effectiveness especially compared to Robert Wise\\'s spare, stark original film which was much more about atmosphere.    Richard Matheson\\'s novel (\"Hell House\")and screenplay for \"The Legend of Hell House\" was something of a homage to Shirley Jackson\\'s novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\" (and Robert Wise\\'s classic film adapted from it \"The Haunting\"). The two novels and films have the same basic premise but go in different directions with them.    Physicist Lionel Barrett (Clive Reville)is hired to investigate the possibility of life after death. The location selected is that of the Belasco House once owned by the imposing Emeric Belasco. According to legend, Belasco was a sexual pervert who tortured his victims and their spirits supposedly still reside inside its walls.    Barrett hires two different mediums to participate in the experiment with him and his wife ((Gayle Hunnicutt). The first psychic is Ben Fischer (the late Roddy MacDowall)a survivor of a previous experiment in the house who reluctantly agrees to participate because he needs the money. The second Florence Tanner (Pamela Franklin)has her own motivation for wanting to join the party.    Shout Factory does a nice job of renovating Hell House for its Blu-ray debut. The film has never looked quite this good--images are quite nice with depth and there\\'s little to no debris evident in this transfer. There are occasionally small scratches and speckles but, on the whole, the film looks quite nice. I was a bit concerned, not because Shout Factory hasn\\'t put out good product before, because this is more of a cult film that wouldn\\'t normally receive the TLC that it deserves.    The audio is clear with the original mono soundtrack receiving a nice sounding transfer. This version does not include the 4.0 mix that Fox made for the DVD. Subtitles are provided in English. The moody score sounds quite nice here as well.    The special features are pretty good as well. They may not be as extensive as what Shout provided for some other releases, but they make up for quantity with quality.    We get a 30 minute interview with director John Hough. Hough has directed a number of b-movie classics and provides insight into his approach in shooting \"The Legend of Hell House\" as well as \"Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry\" another cult classic that he is responsible for.    The second major extra is an audio interview with Pamela Franklin presented as an audio commentary track. While there are long periods of silence, she does provide an interesting contrast to some of Hough\\'s observations.    We also get a photo gallery, vintage radio spots and the theatrical trailer rounding out the extras for this release.    As usual Shout provides us with a reversable cover--the outside is the original theatrical poster while there\\'s newly commission artwork on the reverse.    \"The Legend of Hell House\" is a film that I didn\\'t think would receive a Blu-ray transfer and I\\'ve always enjoyed and admired what Hough, Matheson and the cast did with their small budgeted film. I\\'m a sucker for 70\\'s horror films when they are well made and \"Hell House\" falls into that category. Fans will enjoy this as the transfer is exceptionally good with nice extras.

       " (\"Had Tivo since 2002 originally with Direct TV. I was an early adopter of DVR. Tivo I thought was an amazing product. I was totally satisfied with my Tivo on Direct TV although I was not able to take advantage of updated software since my box was so old. We finally got a new TV in 2011 (HD) and I needed to upgrade receivers. Of course Direct TV didn't really offer a Tivo option so I was forced to use their DVRs only to find that they were far inferior to Tivo. Lived with it for 1.5  years and decided that we wanted to cut-the-cord and ditch cable. I tested several options (Roku, Apple TV, opensource DVR) and found that Tivo was far superior in technology and functionality. So we decided to move forward with Tivo. The only issue with my Tivo is that fact that I can't take advantage of my Amazon Prime Instant Video. I felt that this was mis-advertised - there was no disclaimer that I saw. Even though its not a deal-breaker, I think it is important for Tivo to develop this capability/licensing.\",\n",

Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<br /><br />There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<br /><br />The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.\",\n",

       " (\"In The First Seventh Night (original Cantonese title - Tau Chut), a cabdriver - nicknamed 'Map King' for his unerring sense of direction and ability to find out-of-the-way places - is hired by a slightly mysterious stranger dressed in black to take him to a place called the Moon and Sun village.  This village, whic was a poor and sparsely populated little collection of houses and buildings in the middle of nowhere even years ago, is now pretty much abandoned, semi-mythical even, and though Map King's fellow cabrivers have heard of it, none has a clue just where it's supposed to be.  Upon taking the job, the driver is told by the stranger, who goes by the name of Pony, to lead the way and he'll follow along behind in his truck.  Along the way of the hours-long drive, the two converse by CB radio, and we hear quite a bit about the history of the Moon and Sun village and the rumors surrounding it.<br /><br />This movie is done in the general style of Hero (the Jet Li one) and The Usual Suspects, as more than one account of past events is related to the viewer by different characters.  Apparently, some great tragedy happened in the village some years back.  But what was it really, and are either of the characters, as they continue talking, really telling the full truth?  About one third of the movie takes place in the present, the rest in flashbacks that sometimes (deliberately) contradict each other.  The title of the film refers to the belief in a number of Asian religions and cultures that the spirit of a recently deceased can return to its loved ones seven days after death.<br /><br />If you want to find faults to take issue with, it's not that hard: the movie is limited a mite by an obviously low budget, certain special effects leave something to be desired, and a couple of moments seem to have a vaguely humorous air that I don't think was intentional.  However, focusing on those shortcomings is kind of seeing the glass as ten per cent empty rather than ninety percent full.  The movie as a whole is original and truly suspenseful, has some good frights, good acting and a very interesting angle for characterization, in the form of 'which parts of the flashbacks about any given character are right, if any'.  It's also got some unexpectedly moving scenes that might prompt a non-horror fan who enjoys dramas to take a chance on this particular horror movie.  Many Asian movies, whether horror, action, or otherwise, end up inserting a bit more of an emotional punch than one might expect.  And, as usual, these kind of elements don't interfere with other elements (like the scare factor or the mystery factor); instead the different components tend to make one another more powerful.  I haven't seen any other movie that's quite like this one, and despite the occasional shortcoming, The First Seventh Night is recommended all the way.  Four-and-a-half stars.\",\n",

       " (\"Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.<br /><br />Sometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.<br /><br />The world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.  Trail of Dead could be the last Scarlett Bernard Novel but I am hoping that I saw a small set up for the next book.  I will certainly be on the look out and hoping that the series will continue.<br /><br />Trail of Dead is scheduled for publication June 4, 2013.  I received an advanced reader's copy review copy of Trail of Dead from Amazon Vine.  You should pre-order your copy now.\",\n",

It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.<br /><br />It IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.<br /><br />Features I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers.<br /><br /> Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range. I've used it about a month and haven't noticed a decrease, if it doesn't last over time, I'll update this review.<br /><br />MY DISLIKES:  It's bulky and big to store, and it is heavy.

My final two were the Samsung H5900 or this player. Both 3D, Both good reviews. At retail they were about evenly priced. I ended up getting this player for $64.99 Shipped. It is a fantastic player and I couldn't be more pleased.  I don't use the apps on it since my TV has them and I'm a rare HTPC user for 90% of my content. However, once I connected it to my network it did find some media on my desktop and I could stream it without even trying to. It had no issues streaming HD rips (10gb or so) via its connection.  I haven't had a single issue with any discs I've put into it. The interface is simple and functional, perhaps not the prettiest, but I could care less. Blurays look fantastic, the color really pops and the movies are crisp. It outputs 1080p/24p which my F8500 handles wonderfully. Completely smooth.  I do have one complaint, but I won't take off a star since the whole industry does this: For those of us with receivers and audio gear, keeping gear the same width and stackable has huge advantages, this unit replaced a full width Marantz DVD player, and its 7 inches smaller. Please bring back this style and not just at your top tier, the 7200 that has the audio gear case offers no benefits over the 6500 for $100 more.  I hope this review was helpful!\",\n",

I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].

I replaced the battery once I think (numbers started getting, and the band once (yes, you may have to call Timex to find it, but they definitely can supply it at a reasonable price). When the second band wore out, I decided to buy a new one rather than replace the band: the old one was really working fine though some of the markings on the face were beginning to fade and the face itself was slightly scratched.<br /><br />The second one is going strong after a couple of years. (I'm no longer wearing it during vigorous exercise as I realized that was a primary factor in causing the bands to wear out: constantly getting it wet with sweat.)<br /><br />It's got lots of alarms (I use three different alarms depending on the day of the week; I enable/disable them as needed), a very serviceable count-down timer, and a solid stopwatch. It also supports multiple time zones, which I use occasionally. I have used it for keeping time while refereeing soccer games: works great. Despite the prominence of the compass points on the face, I've never really used that aspect of it so won't comment on that. It also has a couple of other timers/features that I don't use; you can hide the unused features so they don't show up as you're toggling through the active ones.<br /><br />It's comfortable and is casual-looking which fits my lifestyle (without looking &#34;cheap&#34;). The leather is easy on shirt sleeves (compared to the velcro ones: I found that the roughness of the velcro strip tended to fray my shirt cuffs over time).

The operation of the handle is also much easier to fold back than some I have seen.<br /><br />Installation was so easy.<br /><br />The material feels durable without being stiff.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The canopy doesn't cover much at all.<br />The seat is quite heavy, but most are heavier than they should be in my opinion.<br />The seat (when in the base) takes up quite a bit of space in my car (2013 Acura RDX).  It wouldn't fit behind the driver as the next fit now will.\",\n",

       " (\"There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.\",\n",

Easy Access Zipper Pocket And Soft Lined Zipper Pocket To Hold Digital Media Or Other Valuables. Front Zip Down Pocket Includes An Extensive Organizer That Will Hold A Variety Of Business Essentials.<br /><br />*Designed With Checkpoint Friendly/EZ-Scan Feature Which Complies With TSA Guidelines So Your Laptop Does Not Need To Be Removed When Passing Through Airport Security Checkpoints, Allowing You To Get On Your Way Faster.

High Tech Double Density Foam Padding For Extra Laptop Protection.<br /><br />*Side Exterior Features A Zipper Pocket And A Mesh Open Top Beverage Holster. Padded Top Handle And Air Mesh Back Panel That Will Attach To Most Luggage Upright Handles For Hands Free Carrying. You have to love a beverage holster.

I was curious is mount could accommodate Kindle in the standing protective case but it did, and it fit so well that even with a good shake or two before I mounted it on the headrest, the Kindle held tightly in place and wouldn't budge. Being aware that flying objects inside a vehicle during an accident are very dangerous to a little one I wanted to make sure that the device was secure before mounting in front of my 2-year old.
